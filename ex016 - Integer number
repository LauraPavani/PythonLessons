from math import trunc
n = float(input('Insert a number to know what is its the rational number: '))
print('For the given number {} the integer number is {}.'.format(n, trunc(n)))

Or we can make a code without import some library:

n = float(input('Insert a number to know what is its the rational number: '))
print('For the given number {} the integer number is {}.'.format(n, int(n)))
